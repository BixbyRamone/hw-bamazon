# hw-bamazon

Bamazon is composed of two completed .js files, one work-in-progress .js file and some .sql files.

by running bamazoncustomer you can view available items and their prices, or purchase items.

by running bamazonmanager, you can view all items, price, dept, and inventory. You can also add inventory, add new products, and view any items that inventory is 12 or lower

bamazonsupervisor was started, but no functionality was implemented.
